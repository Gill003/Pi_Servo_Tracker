# Pi_Servo_Tracker
Pi Servo Tracker is an automated object-tracking system built using a Raspberry Pi and Arduino. It utilizes a camera module with OpenCV to detect objects in real time. The system employs I2C communication to send positional data from the Raspberry Pi to the Arduino, which controls two servo motors to dynamically adjust the cameraâ€™s orientation and track moving objects.
